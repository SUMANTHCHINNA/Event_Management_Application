# Sample Admin Analytics calculation

Metric	                                Value
Total Users(U)	                        1000
Total Events(E)	                        50
Total Registrations(TR)	                600
Users Unregistered(UU)	                100

Overall Platform Conversion Rate:
𝑂𝑃𝐶𝑅 = ( 600 / 1000 ) × 100 = 60%

Average Registrations Per Event:
𝐴𝑅𝐸 = (600 / 50 ) = 12

Event Unregistration Rate:
𝐸𝑈𝑅 = ( 100 / 600 ) × 100 = 16.67%
